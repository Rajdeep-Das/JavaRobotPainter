JavaRobotPainter
================

The program instantiates a simple bot that draws a specified picture in Microsoft Paint.

NOTE: This program has only been tested on a Norwegian version of Windows Vista with MS Paint version 6.0.
The shortcut keys used by this program can vary depending on the language the windows version is.

A visualization of the code can be seen at my youtube channel: "http://www.youtube.com/teaprog".
